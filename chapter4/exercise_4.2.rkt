; If APplication was put before assignment, application? would trigger due to exp being a pair, this would then try to apply the procedure define on the "arugments" x and 3 in this scenario: (define x 3)

; b. Louis is upset that his plan didn't work. He is willing to go to any lengths to make his evaluator recognize procedure applications before it checks for most other kinds of expressions. Help him by changing the syntax of the evaluated language so that procedure applications start with call. For example, instead of (factorial 3) we will now have to write (call factorial 3) and instead of (+ 1 2) we will have to write (call + 1 2).

(define (application? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'call))
(define (operator exp) (cadr exp))
(define (operands exp) (cddr exp))
(define (no-operands? ops) (null? ops))
(define (first-operand ops) (car ops))
(define (rest-operands ops) (cdr ops))
