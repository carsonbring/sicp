; Measure the number of pushes and the maximum stack depth required to compute n! for various small values of n using the factorial machine shown in figure 5.11. From your data determine formulas in terms of n for the total number of push operations and the maximum stack depth used in computing n! for any n > 1. Note that each of these is a linear function of n and is thus determined by two constants. In order to get the statistics printed, you will have to augment the factorial machine with instructions to initialize the stack and print the statistics. You may want to also modify the machine so that it repeatedly reads a value for n, computes the factorial, and prints the result (as we did for the GCD machine in figure 5.4), so that you will not have to repeatedly invoke get-register-contents, set-register-contents!, and start. 

; From modelling the factorial stack from a previous problem, I am able to see that the max push operations and pull operations can be caculated by the formula 2(n-1), and this also is the formula for the max depth since all of the pushes and pulls happen simultaneously. (after we are done pushing, we only pull until the program is completed)
